# wp-caption-hoist-class


To install via Composer, add this to the repository block (double-check repo path):

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "/Users/joe/Sites/misc modules and libs/wp-caption-hoist-class"
        }
    ]
}
```

Then install the package with this:
```
composer require ideasonpurpose/wp-caption-hoist-class
```




### Notes:

This still needs to introduce styles for the front and backend so captions display properly.

See the TODO directory for an example SCSS file.
